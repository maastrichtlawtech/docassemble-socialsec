  This module assists in determining in which Member State social security premiums need to be paid in case you are performing activities simultaneously in two or more Member States.

  Please note:
    
  - This module is not about taxation. For taxation one has to look at the applicable tax treaty.
  - This app is according the current applicable rules (Regulation No 883/2004 and Regulation No 987/2009). According to COVID-19 measures the rules can be ignored in case a cross border worker is obliged to work at home due to the crisis. This measure runs till 1 July 2023.
  - You are subject to the legislation of a single Member State only, determined by the competent authority.
  - Working from home means that you are working in your residence state.
  - In case of working in two or more Member State one needs a so-called A1-form in which the competent organ of the residence state determines which legislation is applicable.
  - The app does not cover work carried out on board of a seagoing vessel or in the cockpit or cabin of an aircraft.

  Marginal work (<5%) can be ignored.

question: Notice
subquestion: |
  For the next questions, if you perform activities as a civil servant in one Member State and activities as an employee or are self-employed in another Member State, the legislation of the Member State in which you are civil servant is 'leading'. 

  For example, if you work for a Dutch municipality (and are thus working as civil servant) and for a commercial company in Germany, ignore the function as employee in Germany when answering the next questions.
  
  The next questions are about performing activities in two or more Member States as a civil servant for two or more administrations.

question: Notice
subquestion: If you perform activities in two or more Member States on behalf of an employer established outside the territory of the European Union, your social security is always in the Member State of residence (art. 14(11) Reg. No 987/2009).

question: Notice
subquestion: |
  If you perform work as an employee and are self-employed, your work as an employee will determine where your social security is.

  For example: in case you work as an employee in Belgium and are self-employed in the Netherlands, you are subject to the Belgium legislation.

  Another example is that you are working as an employee from home (e.g. Belgium) and in the working State (Germany) for one employer on the one side and working as a self-employed (Belgium) on the other side. In that case the first step is to determine the applicable legislation in case of employment by applying the 25%-rule etc. If the outcome is e.g. Germany because you do not meet the 25%-criterium, then the applicable legislation will be the German one.
